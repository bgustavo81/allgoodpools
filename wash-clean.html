      <h4>Sue Anne Morgan</h4>
      <!-- <small>web developer</small> -->
      <p>Every year, we have a pool pipe that bursts from the below freezing weather in the winter, and our pool becomes more like a swamp until the spring when we are ready to clean it up and prepare it for summer fun, and every year, we call Allgood Pools to come and fix whatever is broken and help us get the pool ready. Justin at Allgood answers the phone and arranges his schedule to help us with whatever we need. He's fast. He's thorough. He's smart about pool repair and cleanup, and his pricing is more than fair. Also, he and his team are just really good people, and we appreciate his great customer service, professionalism and friendliness! As long as we live in this area and have a pool, we will always call Allgood for any of our pool needs, and I would highly recommend Allgood to anyone else who appreciates fast, quality, friendly pool service!.</p>

      <!-- <small>web developer</small> -->
      <p>I have been using this pool service for a little over a month now. They are one if not the best pool service I have had in a long time. I have had pools for over 20+ years. This company does a thorough job. They are not just there 10 minutes and gone. They come every week. And the are very reasonable. I am extremely happy I found them. They have a great online system they send you via email after every service that shows everything they checked and every thing they performed. So there are no questions. I highly recommend this company. Finally a reliable service.</p>

      <p>We have been a customer for over 10 years with All Good Pools and really appreciate their services. They have never let us down on any problems or emergencies we have had concerning our pool or equipment. Wonderful customer service and go the extra length to make sure our pool and surrounding area is perfectly clean. Very happy.</p>

      <h4>Geof Low</h4>
      <!-- <small>web developer</small> -->
      <p>As new home owner with a pool, knowing how to take care of it and what to do is a real nerve racking experience. You can only google so much without getting conflicting information. So I called AllGood Pools because they are local. The service tips and insights I received about my pool were stellar. Using their knowledge I had an pleasantly uneventful pool season.
        Then came this winter. After our super cold winter, I was in need of a major repair. I called AllGood Pools. They came over diagnosed the issue got the parts needed to do the repair and rough quoted me a very reasonable price. The parts came in and we set a day for them to fix the pool. They showed up on time and completed the work. After they completed they walked me through exactly what they did and what was repaired. What more can you ask for?
        I'm extremely happy with all of the service and contact I've received from AllGood Pools. From new pool owner questions to big fixes they have done an amazing job for me. They have earned my repeated business.</p>
